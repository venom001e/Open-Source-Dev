# Contributing to OSS_dev

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OSS_dev! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.
**NOTES**
To maintain OSS_dev as a production-grade project, we strictly reject PRs that follow these patterns:
No "Patch-work" Fixes: Do not submit shallow fixes that address symptoms. If a core logic path is broken, fix the core implementation. We value architectural integrity over quick patches.

No Irrelevant Comments: Avoid adding comments like // this adds two numbers or personal notes. Code should be self-documenting. Only use comments to explain the "Why" of a complex decision, never the "What".

No "Film Script" Commits: Keep commit messages minimal and meaningful.
❌ Fixed the bug where some things were happening and then I changed this file to make it work better after looking at logs
✅ fix(engineer): resolve sandbox clone permission error

No Placeholders: Never submit code with // TODO or // FIXME. PRs should be complete, stable, and ready for deployment.
No any Types: We are a strict TypeScript project. Use the definitions in 
src/types/index.ts
. If a type is missing, create it properly.
No Unnecessary Dependencies: Every added package increases the attack surface and bundle size. If it can be done with 10 lines of vanilla TS, don't add a library.
##

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your API keys:
   # - GEMINI_API_KEY
   # - GITHUB_TOKEN
   # - E2B_API_KEY
   ```
4. **Run tests**: `npm test`
5. **Build the project**: `npm run build`

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks: `npm test`
4. Commit your changes with clear, concise messages
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code formatting (we use Prettier)
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Be descriptive but concise
- No emojis in commit messages

Examples:
```
add langchain integration to analyzer
fix sandbox provisioning for go projects
update documentation for stack detector
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test with real GitHub issues when possible
- Document any manual testing steps in PR description

## Pull Request Process

1. Update README.md or documentation if needed
2. Ensure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution
3. Link any related issues
4. Wait for review from maintainers
5. Address any requested changes
